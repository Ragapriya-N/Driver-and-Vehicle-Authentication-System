The rapid growth on automobiles increases vehicle registration certificate, 
license, insurance and PUC certificate verification by traffic police.
• Sometimes the vehicle owner forgets to carry the vehicle related documents 
at the time of enquiry.
• This results in trouble to the owner and also to the traffic police.
• This paper proposed an approach to solve the issues by storing the vehicle 
related documents at the database by RTO department.
• We can also add provision to trace the stolen vehicle and the web page will 
be provided to the civil police to maintain and update the records.
